Description: Digital Expression Explorer 2 (or DEE2 for short) is a repository
    of processed RNA-seq data in the form of counts. It was designed so that
    researchers could undertake re-analysis and meta-analysis of published
    RNA-seq studies quickly and easily. As of April 2020, over 1 million
    SRA datasets have been processed. This package provides an R interface
    to access these expression data. More information about the DEE2 project
    can be found at the project homepage (http://dee2.io) and main publication
    (https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz022).
